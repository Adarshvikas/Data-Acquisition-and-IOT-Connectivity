# Data-Acquisition-and-IOT-Connectivity

This project focuses on developing a robust data acquisition system for monitoring
temperatures in a heat pipe using a Max6675 converter and K type thermocouples.
Leveraging the versatility of Arduino and Raspberry Pi 4, the system ensures accurate
temperature readings and seamless data transmission to the cloud-based platform
Thingspeak. Through Arduino's sensor interface capabilities and Raspberry Pi's
processing power, real-time temperature data is acquired, processed, and uploaded to
Thingspeak for visualization and analysis. This integration offers a cost-effective and
scalable solution for remote temperature monitoring, applicable in various industrial and
research settings. The project aims to provide an efficient method for data acquisition
from heat pipes, facilitating insights into thermal performance and enabling proactive
maintenance strategies
